## [Visual analysis of printed circuit boards](http://dx.doi.org/10.18725/OPARU-40107)

Bachelor's thesis created by Marco Günther in cooperation with SCHUTZWERK GmbH. It extends existing and new PCB image data sets with new sub-categories for integrated circuits allowing the identification of their respective package. Additionally, four categories for passive and miscellaneous electric components are introduced. The thesis also proposes optimized configurations for selected Neural Networks to analyze populated PCB image data.

## [Algorithm for identification of bus protocols](https://doi.org/10.13154/294-9031)

This Master's thesis by Florian Schmid, which was also created in cooperation with SCHUTZWERK GmbH, describes an algorithm to evaluate voltages which occur on an assessed PCB. The algorithm attempts to identify the functionality, originating protocol and protocol transmission parameters of a measured voltage dataset. While the previous publications established the hardware and visual analysis capability of the PROBoter, this thesis extends its functionality by the evaluation of voltage signals.
