# PROBoter - A platform for automated embedded system security analysis

![PROBoter title image](/docs/title.png)

The PROBoter is a hardware and software platform to automate embedded system security analysis. The initial prototype was developed during the master's thesis **Automatisierung der hardwarenahen Sicherheitsanalyse von eingebetteten Systemen** in cooperation with [SCHUTZWERK GmbH](https://www.schutzwerk.com) and
[Hochschule Kempten](https://www.hs-kempten.de) in the context of the [SecForCARs](https://www.secforcars.de) project.

The project consists of various components which can be found in individual subfolders of this repository:

- [firmware](/firmware) Contains the firmware running on the 3D printer boards driving the PROBoter hardware platform.
- [hardware](/hardware) Contains 3D models and construction data of the PROBoter hardware platform.
- [image_data_sets](/image_data_sets) Contains image data sets to train or validate algorithms for IC and pin detection.
- [publications](/publications) Contains publications related to the PROBoter. You can also find citation information here if you want to reference our work in other research publications.
- [software](/software) Contains software components forming the high-level software part of the PROBoter platform.

Most parts of the platform are licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt). Detailed license information and used third-party components can be found in the individual subfolders.

Other components will be released soon. Follow the [SCHUTZWERK PROBoter blog post series](https://schutzwerk.com/en/43/posts/proboter_01/) to get updates of the current development status and new component releases. So stay tuned... :)
